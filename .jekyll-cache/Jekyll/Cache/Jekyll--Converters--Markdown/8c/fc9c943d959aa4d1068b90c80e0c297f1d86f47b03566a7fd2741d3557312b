Cig-cycle is a cigarette receptacle that is targeted to help reduce the amount of cigarette filters that litter the floor in our city. During our initial research phase, we would notice how cigarette filters would be very common on the ground, planters, and every crevice in between. What was interesting was how many people would be smoking by the entrance of our school's building. Our proposed solution was to build a more visible smoking receptable to help gather the cigarette filters with the hope of recycling the filters to companies like Terracycle. 


<b>Prototype 1 &amp; Test 1:</b>
In class we did a user testing session to talk about our different initial designs with our classmates. Many of the designs have similar features such as giving those who smoke an opportunity to ash and a place to leave their cigarettes. Something we explored was the idea of gamifying the system to help encourage users to place cigarette filters in the system, however due to damp weather conditions we couldn’t justify using electronics for our installation. The shape that classmates liked the most was the one that was a tall cylinder, which would gather attention and allow people to hover by it. 

The initial prototype was modelled in Autodesk Fusion to get a better sense of the scale we wanted which would be about 5.5ft tall. The initial prototype was built with stacked Pringles cans that had lids glued to their base, allowing the tower to be a modular piece, for easy set-up and break down. In addition, we got a shoebox for the base with rocks to help keep the whole structure grounded. For this iteration, we used a lid of a tin can for the ashtray and cut holes into the top-most pringles can where people can stub and dispose of their cigarettes respectively. The prototype was dressed to look like a cigarette to help gather attention of people passing by the entrance.

Initially, there were a lot of looks but people weren’t sure what the purpose of our project was. Once we included signage, it cleared up the confusion and people started to interact with our project. Users weren’t too sure if they would leave their cigarette filters on the ashtray or to insert them in the holes. At the end of this iteration we learned that the signage helped inform users on what to do, the ashtray wasn’t deep enough, the base was too light, and there was an equal amount of people leaving filters between the ashtray and inside. At the end of the 4 hour period, we got 11 cigarette filters. 

<b>Prototype 2 &amp; Test 2:</b>
For this iteration of the project we wanted to make some structural and user interface improvements. We added more rocks in the shoe box base to help hold things together and some rocks in the first two pringles cans from the floor, to negate higher wind speeds. In addition, the structure was rewrapped to look less makeshift and catch more attention from others. Each of the Pringles cans were wrapped individually where at the ends of the cylinder, the paper would be folded over, making the tolerance between the cans and lids have a tighter fit. 

Initially we replaced the ashtray with a deeper dish, with chicken wire to decrease the depth for people to ash, however with some user feedback it wasn’t easily understood as a place to ash.  And since the mesh is more on the flimsy side, it wouldn’t be reliable in stubbing cigarettes. We took out the chicken wire and redesigned our system where we used both tins, one to ash/stub out cigarettes and the other to store the cigarette filters. 

After the initial test day, all the cigarette butts were left in the lower tin (as we hoped) and by the end of the 4 hour period we gathered <b>12 filters</b>.The next day we started early and decided to leave our project for a 12 hour period from 9:30am – 9:30 pm, where we would check how many filters were left every 4 hours. 
<ul>
  <li>Morning: 18 </li>
  <li>Afternoon: 44</li>
  <li>Evening: 0</li>
</ul>
At the evening, we discovered our project taken apart and completely cleaned out. Our prediction is that the cleaning crew tried to dispose of the cigarette filters but accidently broke it into 3 pieces. Especially since the floor area outside the lobby was spotless and both tins of our project were wiped clean. Most cigarette filters were left in the lower tin. 

To make sure things weren’t moving we hot glued the joints together and stress tested them to make sure they could handle the weight of the structure. We wanted to make sure another incident like day 2 wouldn’t happen again. For the last day of our test we left it for 8 hours with an additional sign that it was a student project. 
<ul>
  <li>Morning: 15</li>
  <li>Afternoon: 36</li>
</ul>
For this day we didn’t get as many as the previous day and there was about 1/3 of cigarette butts left on the ashtray. What was interesting was that we were getting filters left in our system and there was willingness to recycle cigarette filters. Maybe for a future design, it would be better to use a funnel towards the center of the ashtray to help make it more convenient for users to stub and then leave their filters without having to think twice. In addition, it may be worthwhile to work with city planners to install cigarette filter receptacles to help reduce the amount that ends up littering the floors and neighboring plants.
