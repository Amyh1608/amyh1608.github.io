I"‰<p>Geisel Library is a study hub for UCSD students and faculty. In this project, I wanted to challenge how one interacts with a library space, as information becomes more available, libraries tranform into more social spaces. <br /><br />

The website listens to the audio input of a device and rates the level of noise. Based on that, the windows of the library will fill from top to bottom with Instagram photos tagged with #geisel, as floors are less noisy the higher the level. In addition, Twitter posts with #geisel will run across the screen. <br /><br />
