I"¤<p>My primary role was programming the solid state machine and using sensors to determine which the cart was and where to move it to. A digital interface was designed in LabVIEW to test hardware before implementation in our final system. <br /><br />
 Part of my role was modeling the 2D drawing in Solidworks. The design features a threaded rod to help with the stability of our cart and a triangular prism shape.
