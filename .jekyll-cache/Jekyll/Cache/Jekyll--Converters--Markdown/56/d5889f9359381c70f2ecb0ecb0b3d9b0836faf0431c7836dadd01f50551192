The purpose of Ultimate Spider Spider Revolution was to build a toy for a child audience, where we took inspiration from Dance Dance Revolution to encourage movement in play. <br /><br />

My role was programming the electrical components in our playmat and to laser cut wood panels to house the LEDs. A prototype was made on breadboard to replicate what we wanted in our final iteration. The switches will light up randomly and turn off when pressed.
