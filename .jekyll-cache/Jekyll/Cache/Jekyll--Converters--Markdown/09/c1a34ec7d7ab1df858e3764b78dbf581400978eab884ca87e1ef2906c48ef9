Remnants is a VR experience that has escape room elements. The player finds themselves in a peaceful cabin in the middle of the woods. As they interact with the objects in the room, they will regain their memories before they can leave. <br /><br />

In my initial Unity environment, I built the room using primatives and premade assets. After gaining feedback from classmates, I decided to focus on using low-poly assets and to make models in Maya to supplement the environment I was envisioning. <br /><br />
