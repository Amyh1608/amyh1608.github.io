Solidworks and has an insert on each half for the LED ring lights. The command unit is controlled with an Arduino which has commands such as ‚Äúsay hi‚Äù or ‚Äúeat food‚Äù. Each LED is representatives
individual ‚Äúneeds‚Äù the program is accounting for when weighing actions. If actions aren't completed within a specified timeframe, the health goes down.
