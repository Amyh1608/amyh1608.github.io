Cig-cycle is a cigarette receptacle that is targeted to help reduce the amount of cigarette filters that litter the floor in our city. During our initial research phase, we would notice how cigarette filters would be very common on the ground, planters, and every crevice in between. What was interesting was how many people would be smoking by the entrance of our school's building. Our proposed solution was to build a more visible smoking receptable to help gather the cigarette filters with the hope of recycling the filters to companies like Terracycle. <br />

Cig-cycle was placed outside by an area people would gather to smoke. Initially, there were a lot of looks but people werenâ€™t sure what the purpose of our project was. Once we included signage, it cleared up the confusion and people started to interact with our project. Users werenâ€™t too sure if they would leave their cigarette filters on the ashtray or to insert them in the holes. At the end of this iteration we learned that the signage helped inform users on what to do, the ashtray wasnâ€™t deep enough, the base was too light, and there was an equal amount of people leaving filters between the ashtray and inside. <br />

In our final iteration of the project, we made some structural and user interface improvements. We added more rocks in the shoe box base to help hold things together and some rocks in the first two pringles cans from the floor, to negate higher wind speeds. Initially we replaced the ashtray with a deeper dish, with chicken wire to decrease the depth for people to ash, however with some user feedback it wasnâ€™t easily understood as a place to ash.  And since the mesh is more on the flimsy side, it wouldnâ€™t be reliable in stubbing cigarettes. We took out the chicken wire and redesigned our system where we used both tins, one to ash/stub out cigarettes and the other to store the cigarette filters. <br />

What was interesting was that we were getting filters left in our system and there was willingness to recycle cigarette filters. Maybe for a future design, it would be better to use a funnel towards the center of the ashtray to help make it more convenient for users to stub and then leave their filters without having to think twice. In addition, it may be worthwhile to work with city planners to install cigarette filter receptacles to help reduce the amount that ends up littering the floors and neighboring plants.
