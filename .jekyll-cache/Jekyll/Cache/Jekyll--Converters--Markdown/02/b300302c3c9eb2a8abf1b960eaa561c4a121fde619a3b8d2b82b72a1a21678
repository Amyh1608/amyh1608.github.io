Our pinball machine was built around a deep sea theme in a rapid prototyping environment. 

My primary role in this project was modeling the project in Autodesk Fusion, and making sure components my partner and I built fit. These included the fittings for our PCBs (printed circuit
board), Arduino, AC power brick, and components hidden in our lower frame.
