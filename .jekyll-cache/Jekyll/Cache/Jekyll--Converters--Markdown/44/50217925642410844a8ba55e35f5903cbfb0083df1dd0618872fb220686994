The purpose of Ultimate Spider Spider Revolution was to build a toy for a child audience, where we took inspiration from Dance Dance Revolution to encourage movement in play. <br /><br />

My role was the programming of the electrical components in our playmat and to laser cut wood panels to fit the LEDs. The switches will light up randomly and turn off when pressed.
