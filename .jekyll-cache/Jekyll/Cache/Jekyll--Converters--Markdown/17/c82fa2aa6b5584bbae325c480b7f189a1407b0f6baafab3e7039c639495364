The purpose of this project was to build a robotic arm that would use technologies in image
recognition and voice recognition. The project expands on smaller projects learned in the class, the
robotic arm and OpenCV. Through voice recognition, the robotic arm could move along the cardinal
directions. When it detects the target shape, it would pick up the object and store the object in its
chassis. My role in this team was using Solidworks to build the camera mount that housed LEDs to help
contrast our target object against flat surfaces. 

In addition, I worked with an Arduino to implement
voice recognition and a demonstration.
