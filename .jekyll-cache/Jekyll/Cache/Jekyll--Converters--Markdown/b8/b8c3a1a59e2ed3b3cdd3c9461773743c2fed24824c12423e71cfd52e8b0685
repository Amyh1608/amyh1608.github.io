In this class we worked in partner groups to build a system in a rapid prototyping environment. For this project, we built around a deep sea theme implementing components that can be found in a pinball
machine. My role in this project was modeling the system as a whole in Autodesk Fusion, and making
sure components my partner and I built fit. These included the fittings for our PCBs (printed circuit
board), Arduino, AC power brick, and components hidden in our lower frame. We planned out our
playfield on paper, built a cardboard mock up, and prototyped components to ensure everything fit
together.
