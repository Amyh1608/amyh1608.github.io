The purpose of this project was to bring the game Sims into a physical space and challenge the narrative of technology controlling our every actions. The plumbob (head attachment) was modeled in
Solidworks and has an insert on each half for the LED ring lights. The command unit is controlled with an Arduino which has commands such as ‚Äúsay hi‚Äù or ‚Äúeat food‚Äù and each LED is representative of my
individual ‚Äúneeds‚Äù the program is accounting for when weighing actions. If I don't complete the actions within a specified timeframe, my health goes down.
