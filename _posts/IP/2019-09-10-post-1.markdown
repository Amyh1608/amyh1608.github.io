With these sketches I wanted to capture the concept of the left and right side of my brain. On the left I drew myself as I would normally perceive myself in the mirror. On the right I drew myself as how I would imagine myself in my thoughts. I drew a large to small gear ratio to represent my engineering background and where my thoughts go so fast I sometimes don't see simple solutions in front of me. On the other side, I drew a polaroid because I really enjoy seeing the world through pictures. One of my favorite things to do is to gather pictures of related ideas for a project I'm working on to draw inspiration from. Here's to working on my productive doodling skills. <em>Onwards to more sketches. </em>
