<h3>Part 1: Observation</h3>

<p>For my process, I stayed on the 3rd floor of 370 Jay Street during the end of the week to observe how the space was used on the weekends compared to weekdays.</p>

<b>Who:</b> Students (both Undergraduate and Graduate), Staff, & Faculty <br>
<b>What:</b> Review Sessions, Socializing, Group Work, and Working on Assignments.<br>
<b>When:</b> During the end of the week, observations from Friday – Monday. <br>
<ul>
	<li>Friday: More people were in Grad Lab A for Office Hours for Creative Coding. I was in the area since Midterm projects for the class are due this upcoming week and I wanted to listen in to see if there was any additional information that could help with my creative block. The session was driven by the assignments in the other creative coding class since they have more guided requirements.</li>
	<li>Saturday: Had coordinated with other students to come in today to get some work done in the company of each other. There was at most 5 people in the space during the time I was there. It was refreshing to see the space more empty than usual and walking around felt more exploratory</li>
	<li>Sunday: There were initially less students who came in during the day, but towards the evening there were a couple more students in the space. Total there were about 5 students who were in the space at different times of day. R. Luke Dubois happened to walk by and chatted with us about a Voting Machine from the 1920s that he had remixed with personality traits. He explained how the machine worked and how he had made additions to expose some parts of the machine that would be otherwise hidden.</li>

	<li>Monday: Livelier than the weekend, however less than usual since today is a holiday, I would say there was about 20 people in the space that used the space today, mixed between students and staff. A lot more of the area is being used today than the weekend, despite being a holiday today. </li>
</ul>
<b>Where:</b> 3rd Floor of 370 Jay Street <br>
<b>Why:</b> An area I find myself working in before or after class. I feel I am usually more productive on campus than I am at home, and made a lot of progress in a lot of my projects here. I was curious about how the space was used during the weekends as opposed to the time I'm usually occupying it. While working in the space, I discovered that it was difficult for me to brainstorm ideas visually in the space. Although there are whiteboards and glass walls, I don't carry an expo marker on me to utilize that resource. Instead, I find myself scribbling notes on coffee filters for visualizing how something will work before I recycle it.

<b>Some things I never noticed before:</b> 
<ul>
	<li><b>IDM Equipment Rental:</b> I knew it existed however I never knew where it was located on the floor. It’s not clear and very out of the way from the usual foot traffic in the area. </li>
	<li><b>ID Scanner on Doors:</b> During the weekend the doors leading to the space were shut and to gain access you would need to scan your ID again. I never noticed this security measure before because the door was almost always open before coming in.</li> 
	<li><b>Lab A:</b> I never awknowledged that there was a room between the two Grad Labs. A professor had told me about this space and how it was planned to have resources for students to build more physical projects. It's still unpacking and getting ready to be used, which could be why I never noticed it as I walked through the halls.<p align="middle"><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1L3edlIV2DpipxmOvKUs-PFM1hMDtnUam" width="100%"></p></li> 
</ul>

<b>What stood out to me:</b>

The whiteboards and the drawings on the glass walls during my walk through of the space. They don’t seem to change often, and I wonder if it’s because of the lack of resources (expo markers/erasers) or because of the type of information up (that may look important). I took some initial videos and pictures of some of the information on the walls and whiteboards to see if they will change over the time of my study. I would want to revisit this when there are more students in the space.

When there are notes on glass, taking photos of the information is difficult, but it can be easily seen by the human eye.

On Monday, I found where some expo markers and erasers were hiding! They are in the front of the space and hidden by desk dividers. Since it’s in a location like this, I wonder if it’s primarily for clubs/teaching sessions when explaining concepts.

<b>What's unique:</b>
What makes the space unique is the addition of the lounge space that transformed the Grad Lab to be a more casual productive space. I normally take advantage of doing work with the monitors in the space because I like being able to expand my desktop to multiple screens. When I worked in the lounge space this past weekend, it was nice place to finish some reading and viewing assignments. What made it a little uncomfortable was the distance between the table and the seating of the couch. I also learned that the yellow chairs can spin! The space is nice to take a break while doing less labor intensive work and left me feeling more motivated.

<b>Potential Growth:</b>
One space I felt was a little empty was the space between the two Grad Labs. There was more furniture in the area that got moved to Grad Lab A. What could be a good use of the space is maybe displaying projects from the students or using it as another type of productive area. This space has a lot of options to be tranformed to and has potential to change the narrative of the space.
