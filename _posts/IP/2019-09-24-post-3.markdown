<h3>Part 1</h3>
Moving to NYC, I had packed as much as my life into 2 checked bags, 2 carry-on bags, and 1 backpack. The challenge I had when I was first packing everything was making sure the checked bags weighed less than 50lbs. My friends had watched me haphazardly move objects between bags, weighing the bags on a digital scale, and carefully distribute the 92lbs of necessities I decided to bring with me. 

Of the things I packed, I brought some objects that held a lot of sentimental value and lots of pictures to decorate the walls of my room. For the <b> Time Capsule </b> I did a sweep of my Marie Kondo'ed room to gather some of the objects I wanted to include.

	<li>
		<b>Duck Stuffed Animal</b> My roommate from undergrad got this for me after her study abroad program in Korea. My boyfriend has an affinity for ducks, and it was something to remind me of him when he isn't around. The duck has been hanging on the mirror doors of my closet for 3 years and currently hangs on my new closet door.

		<b>Detective Pikachu Headband</b> My roommate from undergrad and I went to Comic Con 2019, where we dressed in a yellow T-shirt and jean shorts. At the event there was a Detective Pikachu walk through where at the end you spun a wheel and you were lucky you would win a set of these headbands. For me I got it but my roommate hadn't. So, we waited around to try to buy if off anyone behind us who would be willing to. Thanks to the group behind us to gave it to us for free and helping us keep our twinning aesthetic. <p align="middle"><br><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1j-xJc574Jx8ntYFwDkelDZRw8_BS5yLL" width="50%"></p>

		<b>Shiba Dish and Pins</b> My roommate from undergrad made me this dish from her pottery class, since I am a little bit obsessed with them... I also collect some enamel pins that I keep on a backpack. The first pin is from my undergrad and my graduation year. The second pin was from a job fair from Disney and one of my dream companies to work for in the future. <p align="middle"><br><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1O-36KPXDNDnp6v-KDsv-3KOCNDaeoOL2" width="50%"></p>

		<b>Chucken Mochi Shiba Strap (Sakura)</b> A memento from my trip to Japan, where I went to play as many crane games as possible. This was won from my sister as I was struggling to get the Monaka plushie (below left). I would play crane games at the Round One in the states and was fairly confident in my skills to conquer the crane games in Japan (below right). When we found some crane games in Japan, needless to say I failed. A lot. As I stubbornly spent an hour trying to win one game, my sister had won many of the smaller ones. She gave me this one as a consolation prize in case I didn't get the plushie I set my eyes one. Which I did win eventually and they both serve as a reminder to both of our attitudes that night. <p align="middle"><br><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tkow14snV6WCcXjuDAmq-ObCIXz5m5oa" width="40%"><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1hf_7pSlMThB_nSU-HdshK9b9hxozSdMb" width="56%"></p>

	<li>
		<b>SDCC Postcard</b> The first time I went to Comic Con was the 50th anniversary, I got this postcard to remind me of it. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Grad Photos</b> My roommate took grad photos of me and friends in my major. We all struggled together and kept each other focused on passing all our classes. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Mario Kart in Japan</b> My trip to Japan we got our international licenses to ride go carts in Akihabara. It was pouring that day and we weren't sure if we were able to go out for a ride. When it seemed the rain let up enough to go, it poured about halfway through. It was a memorable experience as I tried to drive half blinded by rain. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Brooklyn Botanical Gardens</b> Some friends visited me right after I moved to NY and definitely helped made the transition to moving a lot easier. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Fung Bros </b> My roommate got lucky and won a raffle to a meet and greet with the Fung Bros on campus. She took me along as her +1.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Prom Picture </b> Where I met my roommate in college! My high school's prom occured in her hometown so she met with us and took pictures. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Starbucks Reserve Roastery </b> My relationship status with coffee: it's complicated. I was dependent on coffee in undergrad and I've been trying to fight off the dependence the past year.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Anime Expo </b> One of my closest friends growing up and I would always go to Anime Expo together. Next year would be my 10th year of going and it's definitely has gotten a lot more packed. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Post Mt. Fuji </b> My sister and I after our hike on Mt. Fuji. We felt victorious after our 14 hour hike and making it back to the inn we were staying at.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Disneyland Trip </b> This set of pictures didn't feel complete without having my boyfriend in the mix. We came on this trip to take some graduation photos and have more fun exploring photo-ops. We were also on a mission to get on as many rides as possible which was a success! We finished the park by 7pm and were shocked by how efficient we were.

A lot of the things I've gathered have been really personal to me and cover a lot of different time periods in my life so far. One trend I noticed is how much of these memories are related to my college roommate and how much fun we've had over the years. We're currently 6 time zones apart, but I guess it's an excuse to visit each other soon.
