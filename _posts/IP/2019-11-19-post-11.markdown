<h3>Part 2: Research</h3>

The umbrella topic we wanted to focus on for this week was air quality specifically towards the usage and disposal of cigarettes after use. Towards the beginning we were curious if we would have more breathing room focusing on general air quality as opposed to smoking. I used Instagram's question feature to try to gather information from my network through both Instagram and Facebook.

Based on the pictures that were sent to me, they were more focused toward smog in industrial centers or cities. One of these images was a .GIF of a minion balloon that collided with a car on the road and that person commented, “excessive helium use”. What I found interesting was that the images shared or reflected themes of the color of the air or smog from cities. They are also pictures that focus on the ability to breathe. One picture, although in a nature setting in the foreground is a bit ominous because in the background you can see the city smog in the distance towards Downtown LA. The answers on Instagram also reflected the pictures I got, major cities and the colors of the sky. <br>

As I saw all the pictures laid out, it reminded me of when I was growing up and how sometimes when you looked up into the sky, all you could see was blue. But after days when there was rain, it dispelled the smog that was floating in the air and when you looked off into the distance, you could actually see the mountain ranges that surround the Los Angeles area. Sometimes I would think it was a distant dream because of how rare rainy days are in California but when I do it’s magical as if a spell being lifted from the city. <br>

In addition to the visuals I got from my network, I also got a lot of words. I tried to keep the responses as true to what people sent me, shown below. Each message is a response from an individual, the first text section are responses from Instagram Direct Messages, the second text section are responses to the Instagram Story, and the last text section are responses from Facebook.

What I found interesting was how more people responded to Instagram compared to Facebook, where people I haven’t talked to in years were more likely to respond to my Instagram. When having a more in-depth conversation between two of my friends we talked about how sometimes air pollution could be caused by different factors like drought or waste. A friend had been in a car accident where they ran over a trash can, some trash got caught under their car, and caused their car to catch on fire. They walked away from that unharmed thanks to others on the road, however it’s scary to think how small actions from some can greatly affect those that come after them. <br>

After the initial poll, I was overwhelmed. There were so many directions that we could go in with having air quality as a topic, especially when most people who answered are California natives. We regrouped and decided to focus on cigarette smoking and the waste from it since we all noticed cigarettes on the ground. We could also prototype some ways to help collect the waste and then send the cigarette filters to <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/cigarette-waste-recycling">Terracycle</a>, that would recycle them.

We had noticed cigarette butts on the ground but haven’t actively looked at the ground for the quantity or condition of them. During the early week before the rain, there were a lot of cigarette waste gathered in the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>Planters</li>
	<li>Tree Beds</li>
	<li>Along Walls</li>
	<li>Sewer Grates/Covers</li>
</ul>
Later in the week, we went on a hunt for a cigarette ash receptacle in the area. The one we found was by the Marriot next to 370 Jay and was centered towards a small park/gathering area. There were some cigarette butts in them, but we noticed people didn’t usually smoke in this area. After the rain and midday there seemed to be less cigarette butts in the area, but some dry ones can be found in the tree beds.

We also had a survey to get a sense of what people in IDM felt about effects of cigarettes and where the filters go after being used. We also observed where people were smoking in the area outside of the lobbby of 370 Jay Street and counted how many we were able to see and noting any locations and actions we noticed.

What I found interesting were the responses of where people thought the cigarette butts went.
<ul>
	<li>6 mentions of sewers/ocean</li>
	<li>6 mentions of trash </li>
	<li>2 mentions of being left on the ground </li>
	<li>1 mention of ashtrays</li>
	<li>1 mention of recycling</li>
</ul>

During the week, we also counted how many people would be smoking from outside the lobby area. There were anywhere between 0-4 people at a time. To get more insight from the community, interviews were held to learn more about how smokers and non-smokers interact with the space and their thoughts.
