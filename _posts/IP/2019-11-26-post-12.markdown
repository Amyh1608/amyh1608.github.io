<h3>Part 3: Prototype 1 <i>Leaning Tower of Pringles</i></h3>

In class we had a session where we did user testing and talked about the ideas we had for trying to recycle cigarette filters in the community around 370 Jay Street. In the design they follow a lot of similarities where we want to give people who smoke an opportunity to ash and stub their cigarettes, in order to make it more convenient for them to leave their filters in our receptacle. Initially we wanted to gamify the system, where it would be like a pegboard with LEDs by the holes that encouraged users to place cigarette butts in it.

As we got feedback we started thinking about other conditions that might not be ideal to have electronics in the system especially if unattended for longer periods of time and if it rains. When we asked our class about which shape they liked the most, a lot preferred the fully round one, which would allow people to hover around it before leaving their filter behind. With this initial CAD model made in Autodesk Fusion it was what our structure looked like initially in our first iteration.

For our initial prototype we wanted to get something that was cylindrical in shape that we could stack and then dress up into a cigarette (to hopefully gain a lot of attention). Our solution to this was to use pringle cans and stack them to get the height that would be comfortable for those between 5-6ft tall. In addition, we needed something that can serve as a base for our “Leaning Tower of Pringles” where we cut a hole in the middle of a shoe box, where we used the weight of rocks to help keep the structure grounded.

To stack the pringles containers, we hot glued the lids on the bottom of the cans to make our structure modular enough to put up and break down.

We added tape around that seal to make it more secure.

At around 5 pringles cans from the ground, we added a lid of a tin to help contain the ash of the cigarettes. For that section of our structure we secured with a hot glue seal around where the tin and pringles can met and tested its integrity with placing some rocks on it.

We also cut 2 rows of holes with an exacto knife on the topmost pringles can for points where people can insert cigarette butts. Our structure to make it look like a cigarette with some construction paper and disguised our shoebox.

In addition, we scouted the area for a good location to leave our project that would be far away from those walking in and out of the building while still providing enough cover for those who smoked near the lobby.

When we first placed the Leaning Towers of Pringles we noticed that the makeshift ashtray wasn’t deep enough and didn’t have any indication that it was an ashtray. When we placed our structure, it got a lot of glances but since there wasn’t any signage, a lot of people didn’t know what to do except stare. We tried being near the structure to maybe see if we can initiate conversation which failed. We made some quick signs to put up that were neutral in tone and then watched from near the Marriot, far enough where it wasn’t obvious we were watching.

Almost immediately, someone approached it and we had an interview with the user. Some suggestions were that the ashtray felt too small and it was confusing if the cigarette filters should be left on the tray or placed in the holes.

When we watched from afar, we watched from afar for about 3 hours to see what interactions people had with our project. Someone peeked at the top to see if butts were left inside the system, not sure where to dispose their butts. From our occasional peeks, we noticed the following:
<ul>
	<li>2 users used it</li>
	<li>2 left on the tray, 1 stubbed it on the tin</li>
	<li>1 smoked near it and fixed it</li>
	<li>1 smoked while chatting with a friend</li> 
	<li>1 picked up a cigarette from the planter and placed it inside</li>
	<li>The user who fixed it came back with a friend.</li> 
</ul>

Another thing we noticed was that the structure was prone to tilting due to the wind and one potential way of fixing it would be to but rocks in the pringle cans closer to the bottom of the structure. Or make the overall structure a lot more heavier to be secure enough to withstand the high wind speeds. After our experiment, we counted 6 cigarette butts on the tray (not counting 4 we placed there initially) and 5 cigarette butts inside the top pringles can. 
We were overall surprised that people would use our structure because owe were expecting the structure to not attract a lot of attention or be destroyed. What was interesting was that some people who were smoking in the area read the signs and ended up coming closer to the structure and were willing to leave their filters after they finished. What was shocking was seeing someone go to the planter and pick up a butt and leave them in the holes we had cut out.

What we liked about our structure was that it was tall and gathered attention. With the initial curiosity it was enough for some people to study from afar and figure out if they wanted to participate or not after reading the sign. Something that we would want to improve on was the ashtray and making the structure a little sturdier. Some ideas that we have for our next iteration would be to lasercut wood for the exterior, use a deeper metal dish for the ashtray that filtered between the filters and ash, and have a heavier base. We’re going to leave our structure unattended for a few hours tonight to see if there will be any results that differed from what we observed during the day.
