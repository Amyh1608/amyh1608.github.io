<h3>Part 1: Observation</h3>

For the duration of the City as Site, I will be working on a team with Deborah and Ash.  The public spaces that we wanted focus on, were the ones that are located around NYU Tandon that students and the general public interact with. Some ways we investigated the space was talking a walk around the Metrotech Area, taking photos of Fulton Mall, and documenting the streets through a bird’s eye view from the 3rd Floor of Jay Metrotech. Our primary goal is to branch out from 370 Jay Street and interact with more people who aren't affiliated with NYU.

Something that I noticed was how many people generally jaywalk on Jay Street or crowd in the area by the bike lanes. What this reminded me of was an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <i>99 Percent Invisible</i>, <a href='https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-76-the-modern-moloch/'> The Modern Moloch</a>. The main takeaway from this episode was the transition of city infrastructure from being built for pedestrians to being built for automobiles. This cartoon, The Modern Moloch, was a comparison to giving sacrifices to the god Moloch for future prosperity. In making this comparison, it was referring to how thousands of people were dying to automobiles and how the infrastructure wasn’t prepared for those changes. <br><br>Especially  moving from a commuter city to NYC, it’s a completely different feeling where there isn’t a need to drive to get from one location to another. Since the public transportation is sufficient to get people to where they need to go, it’s a bit unnerving to see more people challenge vehicles to a game of chicken. </p>

Another location we investigated was Fulton Mall and how it evolved depending on different times of day and weather. From what I usually notice when I’m walking through Fulton Mall when I get to and from campus, I usually see a variety of changes throughout the day.

During the day, there are more street vendors usually those selling different types of food and snacks for the shoppers who occupy the space. There were a few instances where there are people with more set up stands selling jewelry or wares for non-profit organizations. Since the weather is more wet, those usual vendors are not occupying the space today. The area has a modest amount of people walking but not as stationary. There are cars and busses that drive along Fulton Street during this time, and the sounds around are mostly those of honking and construction. There is sometimes sirens that can be heard in the distance.

During the evening, there are less people as shops are closing and folks are headed home for the night. What I found interesting is how empty Fulton Street is during this time where only a couple busses passed us during this time. In addition, there isn’t a lot of sounds that can be heard at this time. You can hear the occasionally bus passing by or the sound of the cross lights indicating that it is safe to cross. What is also interesting is how much trash is gathered on the streets that magically disappears the next morning.

The next location was getting a bird’s eye view of the streets below us and how people and cars interacted with the space. In this hyper lapse video there are a lot of people who take advantage of low traffic and cross the street when there is a safe opportunity to do so. There is also a suspicious pile of trash that didn’t disappear during the day. What I noticed watching this video was how a there isn’t a lane that separates the direction of traffic and how a lot of cars merge into upcoming traffic in order to pass slower cars. There is also a couple of people who are having a conversation across the street.

The next two views focus on the street views going towards 6 Metrotech and the other going towards the Jay Street Station. On the view focused on 6 Metrotech, a lot of what is happening seems normal. The cars are generally moving with the traffic flow and people walking are sticking primarily to the streets. While people are crossing the building across from us, there is more people lingering closer to the 6 Metrotech plaza, especially since the area has the crosswalk most people take to get between Jay Street. In the view focused towards the train station, we have a bit of blind spot since we can’t see the entrance directly below us. There seems to be more people congregating closer to that area since it’s closer to the subway station. What I found interesting is that people don’t usually jaywalk on this portion of Jay Street but more likely on the perpendicular street.

For some thinking points for our next portion we gathered to write down some initial ideas what we can focus on researching for next time. In this exercise we wanted to create a clusters of what problems or patterns we noticed in outdoor and indoor environments. After we picked one that resonated with each of us that we can research more for the upcoming week. The ideas that were picked were <b> air quality balloon, stress, and ashtrays (cig butts everywhere).</b> With this in mind we want to focus on a physical computing project that can tackle some aspect of these elements or visualizing information that is easily to emphasize with or understand.
