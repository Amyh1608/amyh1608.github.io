<h3>Part 3: Visualize</h3>

<p> For this portion, I will be focusing on all the data collected last week and my whiteboard study. Using the information from last week, I created graphs to better visualize some trends. What made it hard using the post-its were separating multiple items or multiple people adding to the same post-it. Overall, what students requested the most were plants, seating, and school supplies. </p>

Although plants were the top group requested, it’s also the most simple where everyone who suggested plants only wrote “plants”. Since it’s not that interesting to break down, we’ll break down the top three groups after plants for more insights on what students wanted on the 3rd floor of 370 Jay Street.

Some important details of this group are that a lot of these changes are more focused on making a space a more comfortable one, where some notable were “pillows” or “chairs with back support”. Students seem to want more couch space, to probably have more spaces like the one located in Grad Lab A. What was surprising was how close couch, hammock, and comfort were to each other, where students seem to want more comfortable places to relax or do work.

For this group, there was an overwhelming need for more stationary supplies. I wonder if people aren’t likely to carry loose leaf paper or pens on them, where they can instead take notes digitally on a laptop or iPad. Especially since a lot of students are ideating different ideas for their classes and projects, it’s interesting to see stationary as the highest.  The 2nd highest percentage isn’t as surprising. Since the 2nd grad lab is a quieter workspace, a lot of students like having a 2nd monitors to be more productive. Although students like having the 2nd monitor, they are willing to work without them than be in a louder atmosphere.

For changes in the spaces, there some students who want to change the wall layout, whether making a space more open or being able to section off a private study space. A couple were more about having designated spaces for different types of work, such as a group study or studio space. For this category, I feel that wall dividers could be a means that can satisfy some of the other categories.

For use of whiteboards in the grad lab spaces, some important details I noticed were the variety of uses for them. What I was interested in investigating was what would encourage use of expo markers and whiteboard space. When quantifying the information from last week, I didn’t really organize it into a readable format. To help figure that out, I made some notes on the percentages that could be organized into clusters and would help identify the uses of whiteboards in the space. 

<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1P53cwUMuIjQt7ECkJldiBwDVP5q0oNZk" width="100%">How I wanted to visually communicate this information was using the whiteboard in Grad Lab A to make an infographic. There are a variety of uses for whiteboards in the space that can be incorporated to fix a variety of student needs. Like using a large whiteboard on wheels to create a wall or barrier so students can have more privacy with the project that they are working on. The glass walls seem to fit the bill on doodling for some students and can end up being a fun community mural if expanded on further. Something that can be interesting to include would be whiteboard stickers to place on top of some of the tables to facilitate more private or group-based ideation of projects. At the time of writing this, the markers I had left reduced from 10 to 5, but they have found their use in helping some of the other students with post-it note activities, mind mapping, and doodling.
