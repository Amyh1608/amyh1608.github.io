The object I chose to represent in my 100 Things was the Pantone Color Catalogue. For the purpose of this assignment, I will be using paint sample swatches from Benjamin Moore as a stand in to represent the color catalogue. For this assignment I will be telling the story of how an angry person interacts with this object.

Meet Jerry. Jerry has been working hard to support his future and is constantly juggling jobs in order to afford rent in the city. After many sleepless nights, he has been able to save enough purchase his first house, but all the stress of working and moving has made him feel frustrated and angry. <br>

After the long process of moving box after box into his new place, Jerry looked at his walls. They were all red! And all he could see was red, during the open house the walls weren’t this color. In his frustration he flipped some of the boxes he had neatly stacked when coming in. Why are they this color?  <br>

Jerry wants to desperately repaint his new place to not feel angry everywhere he looked. He leaves to pick up a variety of color samples from the hardware store.<br>

Jerry decided on colors for each of the rooms in his new home. And walked into his very red home to make sure the colors fit well together. Jerry was running out of time since he had work in a couple days. <br>

But the moment he walked in, all the color samples changed. They weren’t the colors he picked, and Jerry was super upset. He didn’t have time for this nonsense and feel asleep from all the energy he exhausted. <br>

When he woke up in the morning, the red was gone. And Jerry discovered, the lightbulbs in the home were all tinted red. Jerry couldn’t believe it and sighed in relief.
