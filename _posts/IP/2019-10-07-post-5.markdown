<h3>Part 3</h3>

In the year 2145, it will be 126 years from now. It’s hard to imagine how things will change in 126 years, so I did some research on time capsules that had been opened from the past. One common element was paper or some form of writing, such as a letter or a newspaper. What I noticed was that print was something that we could easily recognize, however with technology (like the mouse in Steve Jobs’ time capsule) they look aged even though it was from the 80s. 

Here’s my planning going into the discovery of my time capsule. Some thoughts I had in mind were how time capsules are found, what the condition the artifacts will be in, and some guesses on observations someone may have. <br><br>

Before drawing my storyboard, I made a small list on what I thought would happen in my storyboard, where the time capsule contents are unknown until dropped.

Here’s my first draft of the storyboard. It changed from my original planning because I wanted to show all of the different parts in my time capsule in a way that made sense. Since the number of panels is limited, I believe future inhabitants would group items that seemed similar to each other.

How I guessed objects would change over the 126 years and how future inhabitants would react to it.
<ol>
	<li><b>Space Ship Capsule: </b> If the casing is still made of wood and PLA plastic, the wood would likely be worn down or rotten if exposed to the elements. If it's in display in a room, it'll fall apart at a slower rate, and likely be more fragile. In 126 years, there will likely be advancements in the space field, and can be mistaken for early renditions of a space ship. </li>
	<li><b>Duckie Plushie, Small Shiba Plushie, and Shiba Dish: </b> What I had in mind were the urns of pets in a mummy's tombs, where they keep the mummy company in the afterlife. Although, not in a tomb I can imagine the rationale would be that the plushies are toys or representations of my pets. For the face of the duckie plush, I feel the face would fade out over time. The shiba plush might be okay since it would be hidden. The two would not be safe from insects that may potentially eat at the fabric. The dish is fragile, and I can imagine will break with handling over the years. </li>
	<li><b>San Diego Comic Con Post-Card: </b> I wonder if San Diego Comic Con will still be a thing in the future. Since the postcard can be exposed to air, some of the ink on the postcard may fade and obscure the references to Comic Con. If the image survives, maybe future inhabitants will guess the structure to be an early space center, unless the San Diego Convention Center still exists. </li>
	<li><b>Photos: </b> Since the photos are in their own bag, they will be safer from outside elements. I hope they retain a lot of thier color to help show different experiences in my life. I wonder if printed photos will still be popular in the future and I predict they wouldn't be as commmon. The people in the photos might not be recognizable to future inhabitants, but some of the landmarks may be familiar and give an idea of how attractions looked in the past. </li>
	<li><b>Pins and Detective Pikachu Ears: </b> Enamel pins are something that are usually found in collections today. But they give off an official look to them, and I don't think future inhabitants would be familiar with them. If they believe the contents to be related to space, they will likely think they are badges of accomplishments rather than collectibles. For the Detective Pikachu Ears, I don't think future inhabitants will know what they are. Pokemon is something from my childhood and in 126 years I don't think it will be as popular anymore. </li>
</ol>

After writing about the thoughts and conditions of the objects in my time capsule, I wanted to do another draft of storyboarding to see if I could better capture those feelings. What I liked about doing sketches digitally is being able to convey colors that adds dimension to how objects are conveyed. I also like how there is more space to include more text.
