The object  I based my 100 things on are the swatches in the <b>Pantone Color Catalogue</b>. Instead of showing colors, I wanted to show different styles under a collection of elements. I’m interested in thinking more about different designs, textures, and symbolism that could be grouped together in a central theme. When I first started brainstorming, I was thinking of using a 10x10 grid where each axis would be a different element/material and the corresponding grid location would be a combination of those elements.

As I started writing out all the different elements and materials I could think of, I felt to stay true to a color collection, that each row should instead focus on a different art style. It was interesting to see what I could come up with in making sure that each representation I did matched the art style I was going for and how it would fit together in the collection. As I started, there were a few challenges where representing the material was a bit challenging, but when thinking about how I could remix ideas, it helped kickstart my process. I started thinking about art styles that I’m inspired by and started putting everything together.
