<h3>Part 2: Research</h3>

<p> To get a sense of the type of people who build the identity I worked with a team to focus on productive spaces and did individual interviews based on the observations I saw last week. </p>

<b>Team Phase 1</b><br>

For this portion we asked students on the IDM floor to put post-its in areas and write what they wanted to see. It was left open ended where the level of enthusiasm is different between our users.

The information we gathered, we organized by groups of where we found the post-it notes to see which areas people saw areas of growth. The two areas with the most post-its were the 24/7 lounge and the window area. Some common themes in these areas were more elements to make the space more comfortable whether with plants, lighting, or furniture. 

Some other areas that follow those themes include the kitchen and front lobby. With the front lobby area, there was also a want to see more student work and the construction by the Ability Lab gone. For the phone booths, being a more private space, students saw a want for the space to be less exposed to the public and the reintroduction of furniture. 

For the two grad labs, there was a want for whatâ€™s provided in Grad Lab B to have some elements from Grad Lab A, such as monitors and couch area. A theme in both were changes to include more materials like stationary or studio workspace. 

When organizing the information by type, there is an overwhelming want for more plants, a change in seating, and supplies in the space.

What was a surprise was how little post-its there were to display work or artwork in this exercise. When chatting with a student in Urban Gardening, they mentioned how their class will be displaying some of their work on the floor. I wonder if others had an idea in the back of their minds that eventually student work/art would be displayed which is why there is a lack of want for it. <br>

<b>Team Phase 2</b><br>
For this portion we asked students to draw what they wanted to see in the 24/7 Lounge Area and the Window Seating Area. What we noticed for the 24/7 Lounge, students wanted to see more furniture and a better utilization of storage space. Since the area is more of a lounge, students tend to want more comfy furniture or have the space as more of a hang out space.

For the window area there was a variety of different seating options by the window. It seemed to be centered on seating that allowed for conversation to be held, like chairs facing each other or a couch. In this area there was also a lot of use of the space that frames the window, such as using it to display things like plants. There is also a variety of different set-ups that could be implemented since there is a lot of space to include different environments to suit the diverse group of students.

For this team portion, it seems that a lot of the people we interacted with were primarily students. From the two methods we used, we found that people overall wanted to change the atmosphere of the space to make it more productive for them.

<b> Whiteboards </b><br>

Towards the end of the last assignment, I wanted to see what would happen if I left some expo markers in Grad Lab A. If students that were in the space would notice or use them.

Towards of the end of last week, I noticed more drawings were appearing on the glass walls of Grad Lab A. And overheard some students wondering if it was ok to use the markers since they had washi tape around them. It seemed that the markers were used more for creative use than for homework assignments.

To get a sense of what I wanted to ask students in the space, I started brainstorming on one of the whiteboards. Something I felt a little guilty about was erasing another student's work except it was the same information the week prior. In my mind map I wanted to capture who and why whiteboards are usually used in a space.

With the mind map, I started coming up with a list of questions that I could ask other students. With a refined list, it would help narrow down some information I wanted to learn more about. Especially if people noticed whiteboard markers in the space, if they used them, or what they have used whiteboards in the past.

I chatted with 10 people in the space and recorded what was said in a Google doc. Some highlights from the conversations.

<ul>
	<li><b>8/10</b> people noticed the expo markers.</li>
	<li><b>4/10</b> noted that they usually use whiteboards for planning ideas or teaching concepts.</li>
	<li><b>3/10</b> noted that they usually use whiteboards for doodling.</li>
	<li><b>2/10</b> noted that they prefer using notebooks over whiteboards. </li>
	<li><b>1/10</b> noted that they usually used whiteboards for interviews and to do lists. </li>
	<li><b>3/10</b> noted that they prefer larger whiteboards. </li>
	<li><b>2/10</b> noted that they thought the markers was someone elses and didn't want to touch them </li>
	<li><b>5/10</b> people said that if they could get access to a whiteboard would more likely use expo markers. </li>
	<li><b>2/10</b> people talked about how whiteboards were more common in MAGNET, where it was also convienent to use. Most of the whiteboards there had expo marker and eraser sets which is a lot easier to come by than on the 3rd floor. </li>
	<li>Whiteboard markers were used for our team assignment in Phase 1. For people to mark up post-its and for us to organize our data.</li>
</ul>

What was interesting were the types of people I talked to in the space, where some have been teaching assistants or in the old space. What was most shocking to me was hearing about the whiteboard usage in the old space compared to here. Looking at the data, it wasn't surprising to see the top two uses were for ideation and doodling. When talking with some of the students in the space, one mentioned that they prefer larger whiteboards because moving them around could create walls or a more private space to work. From students who preferred using notebooks, they felt uncomfortable that everyone was able to see what they were working on. In addition, they feel that there isn't a use since they have methods to store their notes such as an iPad or notebook. From here the theme of how people use a space because they perceive it as more private or public could help narrow down what makes a space more productive to those using the space.
