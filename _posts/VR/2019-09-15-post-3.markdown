For my field study in the past week, I was mostly driven by exploring fun and food. Usually I enjoy being able to explore different parts of a place to discover different installations that are picture perfect or occupy my time. (from Left to Right)
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-bottom:10px">A <b>mirror wall</b> that creates an illusion of creating one face from two people. It took a bit of adjusting from the both of us to get our faces to align well with each other and a pretty fun bonding activity.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:10px">A <b>camera</b> captures images and reflects what it sees on a panel of individually flipped pixels. There isn’t a lot of dimension that the panel can portray, but it does capture the overall silhouette of whatever it sees.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:10px"><b>Legos!</b> Who doesn’t love building with Legos?</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:10px">Paying for food with <b>Samsung Pay</b> on my smartwatch. I prefer paying with my phone since it’s a lot more accessible than through the watch.  My phone has a fingerprint reader that makes the security feature seamless as opposed to punching in a pin on my watch. I enjoy paying for things through my phone since it’s more likely to be out and saves me the trouble of digging through my purse.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:10px">Since I moved from one coast to another, I’ve been trying to find good food places around me. I usually take pictures of my food for <b>Yelp</b> and to keep track of the places I’ve been to so far.</li>
		<li>NY is a foodies dream, and it’s really hard to resist getting picture perfect dessert. Even after being stuffed, there is always room for <b>dessert</b>.</li>
	</ul>

When I was learning to lucid dream, I would record my dreams on any piece of paper that I had access to the moment I woke up. For this assignment, finding paper to record my dreams was the hard part, so I had decided to record my dreams on Google Keep. <br>

For the first dream I had, it reminded me of one of the hardest choices I had when deciding to come to NYU for grad school, leaving behind a team of amazing people at my job. It was a fast-paced environment where there didn’t seem to be enough people for some of the projects that needed to be done on a tight schedule. I recall in this dream that I had been called back to train someone and my welcome back gift was a flaming pumpkin, which was when I realized I was dreaming. In case you couldn’t tell, I feel back asleep after recording what I could. <br> <br>

For the next dream, there was an imminent threat where people in my apartment complex had to evacuate and prepare for war. It started off like a zombie apocalypse where everything was being used to barricade doors and to build weapons. The dream started to transition to more of relying on robotic suits to protect ourselves and gave gundam vibes. To put on the suit, we'd have to open up boxes full of parts that you needed to put together. It gave me war flashbacks of putting together furniture from IKEA. The root of my panic was the router, but realistically, those involve plugging in a couple cables. Perhaps since I just moved to NY, my brain was making sense of all the new life changes. It's overall really amusing the types of experiences my unconscious can come up with.
