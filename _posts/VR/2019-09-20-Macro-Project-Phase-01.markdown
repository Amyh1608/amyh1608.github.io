		<b>Description:</b><br> The type of experience I want to build on is an experience with escape room elements. Escape rooms have become popular attractions in the last few years where a team of people locate clues in a room to escape or solve some mission. In escape room flash games, those games were mostly played individually which isnâ€™t common in its attraction counterpart. The character has been in a dreamlike state where the surroundings are a peaceful solitude and a surreal environment. The character can manipulate the atmosphere but over time realizes that the world around is slowly dying and tries to either escape or get out. <br><br>

		<b>Assets:</b><br> Being put together as we speak, here's a sneak peak. <img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zkiRgIsiunsONO28JTUi8OU0H2nxlhf3" width="49%"> <img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Aj8FwzvSrf3EN_62Z0US-440Fylwwrsn" width="49%"><br><br>

		<b>Mood Board:</b><br> <img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1PVREg2thmETljOTGew2XbmHNMCMDbl45 " width="100%"> The aesthetic that I really like is low poly renderings of nature. I love the unnatural colors mixed with natural elements that still make the setting feel very organic and dreamy.<br><br>
