Last week in class we presented our Alpha to our classmates where I talked about my project, <b>Remnants</b>. Remnants is a game with escape room elements, where the player regains their memories as they interact with the objects in the room.

After the presentation, my classmates filled out this <a href="https://bit.ly/31Xs0bw">survey</a> to provide feedback on how I could build on parts everyone liked and work on parts that can grow.

For this question, a majority of the class felt peaceful in the environment. The next highest feeling was joyful, powerful, and a combination of scared and mad. The results were mostly expected since the environment was intended to be a more peaceful external scene and I'm glad those feelings were able to be communicated. What I want to really push is making the player more motivated to leave the room they are trapped in.

The general feeling I got from what was liked in the project was the overall ambience and aesthetic of the game. What was also hinted at were the some of the game mechanics and the storytelling aspect of the game.What could be improved on is making the room more bright or making the light fit more with the environment. Another part that could be improved on is adding more furniture/interactions in the space. A few people also noted on making the room a larger space which would make laying out some furniture easier but would need more to even out the additional empty space.

For my first phase I used a lot of elements from Google Poly and the Unity Assets Store. I feel the biggest sections would be the couch and plant that would need to be adjusted to fit the overall environment and room better. This is also really helpful in telling me which models I should prioritize making/editing through Maya.

With this feedback, it helped give me context on the part that people felt I could improve on. It seems that more people wanted more interactions and improvement on the lighting. In addition, it seems that in building my environment and interactions with the space, I should add more furniture and accents to the environment. <br>

With this feedback, I feel what I need to focus on is getting the furniture to fit the overall environment inside. No changes on my schedule as of now since my last change, where I will be focusing on the 3D models and building the interactions in Unity.
