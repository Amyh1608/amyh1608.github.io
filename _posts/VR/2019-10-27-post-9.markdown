For this month, I’ve had a lot on my plate. In addition to classes, I’ve been juggling a new job, preparing for a conference, and working on a competition. Though I’ve been making it work so far, after next week when the conference and competition are over, I’ll have a lot more room to breathe. Especially with the transition to final project mode in my classes, I’m excited to have more time to allocate for them. 

The downside of being in constant work mode is finding new ways of procrastinating. Instead of taking a break to unwind, I’ve found myself procrastinating on work by doing work for a different project. What keeps me going is the personal deadlines that I’ve set for myself and doing what I can to put my best work forward. The good part of working on a lot of fun projects for me is learning new tools and building on skills to leverage for future projects. I have been learning so much and I can’t wait to use what I’ve learned in my final projects. <br><br>

Constantly working can be numbing on the brain especially when most of the projects are creative intensive. It’s been a lot of tireless hours of working on my extracurriculars, where I sometimes feel uninspired when tackling on different assignments. By the end of this month, since projects will be concluding, it’ll be refreshing to have more time to unwind. I’m looking forward to having time to check out some local art exhibits and letting my mind wander through all my subconscious thoughts. Like having those “Aha!” moments when cracking a tough equation, discovery through more outlets will hopefully give me more inspiration to make some really awesome final projects. <br><br>
