Instead, I was aware of how many video game companies had tried to commercialize VR in the past however it didn't get a lot of traction due to the video and computing capabilities at the time. Because the graphics of the screens in older systems, the experiences weren’t as fully immersive as one would expect of virtual reality. Instead VR was something that could only be imagined through many derivatives of media, such as through movies and books.

What I find interesting in the history of VR development is how many different forms of media captures the potential of future VR technologies. One of my favorite books that was mentioned was, “Ender’s Game” by Orson Scott Card. It was one of the few books where the climax surprised me, where the game that Ender was playing was really him controlling a fleet in the bugger war. As mentioned by Ivan Sutherland in his speech, “…but it is the great creative people who put the content in to make the technology real to people.” As technology improved over the years, we aren’t taking control of actual wars through VR, however, we’re able to use VR as a tool to train different people in different career paths. By being able to use VR as a tool, I believe it helps support the growth of career paths that can be hard to train otherwise, such as surgeons. 

Another part I found interesting was how different technology can be developed for use in one area, but by changing one part of the design can completely change how a system can be used. Like how Sutherland mentioned in his speech that a pilot could see what his plane sees through a camera, but by changing the camera to be a computer opened the doors to present day VR systems. Even now, with Oculus and HTC VIVE, a lot of the initial advertising was as a video game system. However, instead of simulating a game, it could also help simulate different experiences to help immerse an audience in a movie or art piece. There is so much potential in VR, that can be more readily explored because of the advancement of technology and I really want to continue on the trajectory that avoids a dystopian future.
