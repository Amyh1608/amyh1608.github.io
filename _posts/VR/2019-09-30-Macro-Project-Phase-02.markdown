		<b>Schedule:</b><br> At this point of the process, the story and escape has been determined.<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1BA2N8BQd0A5yIUDu-5InJk3ux0Yc5sWy" width="100%"><br><br>

		<b>Audience:</b><br>My target audience would be for individuals who are interested in escape room experiences but want to have a more personal connection to it. For this game, I am using the flash game model where someone could play through the experience in one sitting. In addition, I’m hoping my escape room could be a good bridge for gamers to start using VR who don’t want to dedicate a lot of time and resources into a long gameplay. With this game, I want to capture the feeling of relaxation where the player can choose to escape or not, where the pacing isn’t obvious. Something that I would have to consider is that with a short gameplay, I would have to convince a player to want to come back to see different endings that could occur. <br><br>

		<b>Conditions:</b><br> One condition of the environment is to have no one around and to be played in a private space. I want the experience to feel more personal feeling to the audience and all the feelings of solitude associated with it. In the story, the player wants to escape the room they are in because they are feeling the effects of solitude take a toll on them. In replicating that, it would help with the immersion of the experience. In addition, by using ambient sounds that are caused by the player, it would really drive home the feeling of being alone. <br><br>

		In my physical space when first laying out the 7x7 foot square, I was really worried about how much space I had. It made me adjust my story to be able to fit into these bounds as opposed to thinking about how to incorporate more space, by transporting through space. When mapping the space, I had tried to keep the minimum on what was really important to capture in the space. I enjoyed the process, because now I had a more concrete idea on where larger items in the set would fit and how I could fit more elements to coexist in the area without feeling too cluttered.

		For this image, I took the pictures I took of my post-it notes and translated into this image to show where they were placed in the space. Once everything was laid out for me to understand what I was envisioning, it helped me with making a more concrete story on why the player is trying to escape.
