Zander Reyna visited our class to talk about his experiences in working with VR and to give all of use individual feedback on our projects going forward.

Reyna suggested doing some <b>playtesting</b> with my project to make sure people are using the product correctly. In addition he suggested making some <b>UI/interaction changes</b> to trigger people to want to interact with a certain object or thing. I wonder if it would work to use a system like in The Untitled Goose Game where there are tasks to complete by checking off a "To-Do" list. <br>

As a result, I am going to really push to have some playtesting done next week so I can start building my interactions based on what people want or assume they are able to do. Another point that Zander noted was that having the option to move around can easily cause motion sickness and that maybe teleportation might be a better option to have in the room. In doing so, it would allow me to include the feedback that my classmates gave me about making the room a little larger, without causing too much claustrophobia and allowing me to add more interactions with the different furniture in the space.
