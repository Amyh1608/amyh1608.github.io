During this portion of my Macro Project, I had some other students in the class try out my project, Remnants, in the XR Lab. When players started the experience, I introduced the experience as an escape room. As the player enters the experience they are on the bed waking up in a dark room and calm music filling the atmosphere.

While watching, it was interesting to see how others interacted with my experience. Since the lighting is dark at the beginning some would start searching for clues in the dark, while others would attempt to light the fireplace. One person was able to figure out how to light the fire and really liked how the room lit up gradually as the fire started. They also started to place every interactable object into the fire.

Something that wasn't really noticed was the words around the room that drive the story, that appeared on the wall or on the open book. If players noticed words it would only be on objects that were interactable. In addition, there are some actions that didn't have any clues which caused interactions to be a lot more open ended and the game wouldn't be easily completed. Even when the game was complete, the only indicator that the experience was over was a change on what was being displayed on the walls. 

I feel by adding adjustments to the end game section can help make it more clear that the experience is over. For instance, making the words "Wake Up" larger and more noticeable or transporting the player into a scene that was completely dark. There were also some gameplay adjustments I can make to make the quality of play a bit better. I noticed a lot of struggling with the teleport zones being a little too small. In addition, there are objects on the table that are difficult to pick up. I wonder if that's something with the sensors for the headset I was using or if I could make it better by increasing the size of the collider.
