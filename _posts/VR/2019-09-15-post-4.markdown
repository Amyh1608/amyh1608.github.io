When reading this article, the question of what virtual reality is, reminded me of a discussion I had in an undergraduate class. Often when describing digital experiences there is a distinction between what is real and not real. By creating this divide it makes virtual reality experiences feel disconnected to the audience because of the innate perception that the feelings experience the user is in, isn’t real. What I like about this article is that it refers to the physical world as grounded reality, or one that is the norm to virtual reality users. Because of the of the different vocabulary, it gives a better distinction between virtual and grounded reality that doesn’t feel as disconnected and allows virtual experiences to not be hindered by unconscious expectations. 

What was interesting was the point on how something doesn’t have to exist to impact a user. For me, when I’m talking with long distance friends through video chats, or playing games on a voice chat, I feel as if they are next to me. Especially growing up, my fond memories are of playing Super Smash Brothers in my friend’s room where we’d have countless match after match, where sometimes it was for good fun and sometimes to settle an argument. There is a zone my mind goes to when I’m so mentally invested in a game where after I close it, I sometimes feel disoriented and need several seconds to feel grounded again. 

Maybe when first using a VR headset in the same room I’ve played all the Super Smash matches years ago it helped me feel equally as immersed. Though not without a few hiccups starting out. When I first entered the world of Job Simulator, I was super disoriented and confused on my bearings. My friends who weren’t in the virtual world with me would coach me on what I could do and felt more like game overheads who could see everything I was seeing. When I got into the rhythm of the game, for a bit I felt as if I was transported to this world, showing my friends all the silly things, I could do without the usual repercussions. When I removed the headset after a couple hours of playing, I felt the same familiar feeling of stepping out of a game. 

I feel that immersion is going to be different on a case to case basis, however both virtual reality and grounded reality are different types of experiences. I like how being in virtual reality, I can feel as if I’m stepping into different playing fields (as long as I don’t bump into any furniture). It also gives a good enough illusion that provides a safe space to try things out of my comfort zone that I probably wouldn’t do otherwise like jump off a cliff or explore a haunted house. I also like being able to distinguish between those experiences, because it lets me have control on what I want to experience depending on the time and place.
