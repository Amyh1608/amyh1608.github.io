This is a project I worked on that was submitted to the 2018 Disney Imaginations Competition. The prompt was on creating an attraction that focused on one of the Seven Wonders of the World. My team and I decided to focus on the Hanging Gardens and Babylon and created an experience called, "Garden Oasis". My role in this project was to design the outside layout of our garden which I used a combination of Autodesk Fusion and Photoshop (for the textures). <br> 

I'm inspired by this work because for the 2019 Disney Imaginations Competition, I have learned so much in telling a cohesive story where I can't wait to show my progress from a year ago to now. What I liked about this project was working in a team to come up with different ideas and driving our final design. Reflecting on the work that we did a year ago, we had tried forcing ideas to fit into a theme instead of it feeling like a natural fit. We learned that instead of trying to push a theme onto a project, we should have every part of the project related back to our unifying theme.
