Remnants is an experience with escape room elements where the player is tasked to find clues and make their way out of the cabin they are trapped in. The following video shows a gameplay tutorial of the current version and will be demoed in today's class session.

In building this experience, I enjoyed making 3D models in Maya and seeing how they really made my game feel a lot more polished. Maya has a bit of a learning curve that was at first intimidating, but once I started making the models it was easier to get more comfortable with the program. It was also interesting to see how the model may change when imported into Unity. For instance, the cabin has parts that didn't render correctly in Unity, but gives the effect one may get of seeing through logs of a cabin. Below are some of the models built for this project in Maya. Somewhere I would want to improve on is getting the UV Mapping to look a lot nicer, since when putting them together intially there would be areas that would distort. In addition, they weren't the nicest stitches since they weren't the most intuitive to edit in Illustrator/Photoshop. Below are some of the models I built for this project.

Something that was surprisingly a fun experience was writing the scripts for the game. It was definitely overwhelming because there's a lot of information to take in from the documentation. Once I got started, it became a lot easier to figure out some interactions I wanted to include. It was especially rewarding to see the effects I wanted taking place and adding more charm to the experience.
