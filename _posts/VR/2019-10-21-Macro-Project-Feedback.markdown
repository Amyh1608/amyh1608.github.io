Here was some of the feedback I received from Professor Gannis on the Macro Project:
<ul> 
	<li>Take advantage of the XR Lab when it’s all up and running to get a better idea of the interactions that can be made.</li>
	<li>Focus on the feeling/atmosphere of the environment for the Beta Phase. </li>
	<li>Schedule might need to be adjusted and that’s okay. </li>
	<li>Leverage your strengths and be open to learn topics outside of comfort zone. </li>
	<li>Be wary of using outside assets because their scripts might not be compatible to the version of Unity installed on device. </li>
	<li>Next week will be a jam packed session to get everyone kickstarted in building their experiences. </li>
	<li>A lot of the interaction in my proposal is open ended which is good when getting involved in the authoring process, which can be determined when playing with the head mounted display. </li>
	<li>Play on ear: making keyboard interactions vs. VR interactions. </li>
	<li>After meeting note: I wonder if using the mouse and mouse click would be a good basic interaction that could be converted to a button on the controller. </li>
</ul>

Overall the feedback from the professor was really reassuring to help get a scope of what the midterm presentations will look like. From what was discussed, I feel the best thing I can do to make a successful starting environment is to continue binge watching tutorials and get the environment to have all the pieces in place to add interactions. From what I saw in the video demos, I might want to scale down the environment to be more condensed (like the space allowance in Job Simulator), which would make the experience a more intimate one. It would also help simplify some wants in my project by starting on a smaller scale and I could start adding more things as time/debugging allows. <br><br>
Something that I liked about my initial Unity environment was the feeling I could imagine looking outside a cabin window. What I would like to do from here is to have an experience that changes the time of day/lighting of the environment. There are a few adjustments I’ll have to make as I start testing in the XR Lab which will help finalize the type of interactions I want the player to interact with.
