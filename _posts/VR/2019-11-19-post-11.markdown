For this week's class we had guest lectures from Leah Roh and Indira Ardolic, who shared their current project, Digital Arrest. Digital Arrest was demoed in the VR Lab after Leah and Indira shared their individual works with the class. What I thought was interesting about Digital Arrest was how Roh and Ardolic worked directly with Jarrell Daniels to tell his story before he was arrested based on his social media presence. With sharing experiences in a VR space, it helps share stories that mass media doesn’t tend to share, where some focus on mob mentality and perpetuating a whole variety of narratives that may or may not be true. With letting Jarrell tell his story and allowing people to step into his shoes, it helps bring context to the situation that most of us don’t have an opportunity to witness. 

I also had the opportunity to demo Lube River which was a piece from Leah with her studio, Motherlode Lab. Lube River was an interesting experience because it was a fun experience to steer the boat and collect and learn about the objects in this space. What was a little confusing was placing the objects in the basket, where sometimes it wouldn’t go where I wanted or felt I was really far from the bottom of the boat. There were also some instances where the controller wouldn’t detect me trying to pick up the objects and I think I knocked into the desk a few times. The aesthetic of the piece reminds me of the way Miami is depicted in media. It was also kind of reminiscent of themed boat rides in amusement parks and I felt overall amused exploring this space.
