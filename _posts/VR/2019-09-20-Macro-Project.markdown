<h4> Phase 01 </h4>

		<b>Description:</b><br> The type of experience I want to build on is an experience with escape room elements. Escape rooms have become popular attractions in the last few years where a team of people locate clues in a room to escape or solve some mission. In escape room flash games, those games were mostly played individually which isn’t common in its attraction counterpart. The character has been in a dreamlike state where the surroundings are a peaceful solitude and a surreal environment. The character can manipulate the atmosphere but over time realizes that the world around is slowly dying and tries to either escape or get out.

MACRO PROJECT PHASE 01 – Begin conceptualizing the semester long project that you would like to build in VR. You will be the Designer, Programmer, Artist, Sound Designer and Producer of this project. At this point, begin thinking about the big picture of your project. Do not get caught up in little details. What do you want to communicate, express, show and/or address in your project? 
Define your topic loosely. Is this an autobiographical piece? A surreal fantasy? A polemical work? An abstract experiment? Come up with a paragraph composed of 3-4 sentences that describes your project theme.

Begin to build and accumulate assets:
 2D Images 
3D scans of physical world objects  
3D models 
Audio files 
C# Scripts
Videos  
Motion Capture Files 
Color Swatches 
Typography  
Particles and FX examples

Create a mood board, (a collage consisting of images text and samples of objects in a composition. This is used to convey a general idea and feeling about your topic).

Set priorities – List what things are most important to creating the VR experience you are imagining.

Set up a separate section on your process blog for your Macro Project. 

Share a link to this section of your process blog with your professor on Slack. You do not need to upload all your assets and research materials here, but do post 1. Topic description, 3. An image of your mood board and 4. Your priorities list for now.
Make sure you DO KEEP all your research materials in a designated folder on a local storage device and/or on the cloud, as these materials will be submitted with your final project at the end of the semester. Included in this research material should be documentation of your Virtual Object or Experience assignment, as a central inspiration for your project. If your first Virtual Object or Experience no longer feels pertinent, choose a new one, and include it.
