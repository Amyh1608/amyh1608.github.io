<p>The article by Paul Bloom resonated with me the most. I agree that even though you're in a space where you can try to empathize the feelings or troubles of another person, you truly can't be in the same shoes of them. Especially with extreme situations where the scale of the issues are a lot larger and more difficult for the general public to empathize with.<br><br>

For instance, Bloom talks about how some VR experiences put a user into a scene where you're suddenly evicted and find yourself homeless. What is offsetting about this point is that there is a vast net of why someone is homeless and I want to empathize with those who don't have any other alternatives. However, Bloom also talks about how our inert biases can affect how we empathize with other people.  I recently was stopped on the street by someone who said he was homeless and going through a rough time. He said he was hungry. He said how people have been rude to him and he had lots of love to give. I don't usually carry cash on me and at the time I was in a rush somewhere so I couldn't spare time to buy him a meal. But I did have some snacks in my purse that I could offer. When I did, he started to be angry with me saying how he needed a meal, not a snack. At the end of that confrontation his demeanor changed, he called me a racist slur and walked away. <br><br>

That experience left a bad taste in my mouth because it felt like the help I was able to offer at the time wasn't enough. The brain remembers these negative experiences the most and innately causes me to be suspicious of situations like this. If I was in a protected virtual space where I was in their shoes, I would likely feel less empathy because I'm seeing scenes unfold around me, and I'm not physically or emotionally grounded there. I am more suspicious to these interactions and makes me want to learn more about what's going on inside someone's mind to learn if their intentions are sincere. The scale of some of these issues are a lot larger than can be quantified in an experience (VR or not), but even experiences can serve as a tool to meet a means. Even if empathy can't be expressed, virtual experiences can help raise awareness of situations that are otherwise hard to express. </p>
