<p>Geisel Library is a study hub for UCSD students and faculty. In this project, I wanted to explore how one interacts with a library space, as information becomes more available, libraries tranform into more social spaces. <br><br>

The website listens to the audio input of a device and rates the level of noise. Based on that, the windows of the library will fill from top to bottom with Instagram photos, as floors are less noisy the higher the level. In addition, Twitter posts will run across the screen at varying speeds dependent on the sound. <br><br>
