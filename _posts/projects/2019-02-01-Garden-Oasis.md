<p>
The theme of the competition was to create an experience based on one of the Seven Wonders of the
World, and my team chose the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. For our design, Garden Oasis, the garden is surrounded by an infinity river and features a dome structed rooftop greenhouse. <br><br>

My role was to create the initial CAD model and render the final details our of attraction.
