<p>
The purpose of this project was to bring the game Sims into a physical space and challenge the idea of technology controlling our actions. The command unit is controlled with an Arduino which gives the user actions to follow. <br><br>
Each LED representatives individual “needs” the program is accounting for when weighing actions. If actions aren't completed within a specified timeframe, the users health goes down.
