<p>
Lens is a UX Design project focused on creating a web accessibility debug extension. The problem statement I focused on was: <br><br>

Frontend developers have trouble with understanding how their web applications impact those with low vision. The purpose of this design was to show how websites were interpreted by those with low vision and assisitive devices, and help developers incorporate better web accessibility practices earlier. <br><br>
