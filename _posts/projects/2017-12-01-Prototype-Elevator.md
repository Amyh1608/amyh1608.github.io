<p>
A team project where our design featured a threaded rod to help with the stability of our cart and a triangular prism shape. Part of my role was translating the 2D drawings into a 3D model in Solidworks. <br><br>
My primary role was programming the solid state machine in our closed loop system. A digital interface was designed in LabVIEW to validate hardware before implementation in our final system.
