<p>
A.me is a companion routine robot that would notify the user of actions to complete based on the time of day. For a week during the pandemic, I lived with A.me to help me better track time during the day and promote better habits. To add presence to the robot, OLED eyes were created that blinked throughout the day. When there was no light in the room, the eyes would close, as if A.me was also sleeping.
